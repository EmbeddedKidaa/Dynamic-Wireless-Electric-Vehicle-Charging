# Dynamic Wireless Charging For Electric Vehicles 

This was my **diploma capstone project**.

In this project, my teammates and I developed a working model of **dynamic wireless charging for electric vehicles (EVs)**.

**Range anxiety** remains a major challenge for modern EVs. Despite offering considerable range on a single charge, many consumers still feel uncertain about whether the battery will last for their entire journey. Additionally, long charging times and limited charging infrastructure further contribute to this concern.

Dynamic wireless charging addresses these issues by allowing EVs to **recharge while they are moving on the road**. This is achieved using **inductive wireless charging technology:primary coils** are embedded beneath the road surface, and **secondary coils** are mounted on the underside of the electric vehicle.

The power required for this charging system can come from **renewable energy sources**, such as **solar panel**, promoting sustainable transportation. To implement this, a **dedicated lane** can be built for EVs that need to recharge while driving, helping them extend their range without stopping.
